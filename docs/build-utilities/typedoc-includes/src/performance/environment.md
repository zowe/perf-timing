#### Performance Variables

The following environmental variables affect the operation of the library:

| Variable Name | Type | Default Value | Description |
|---------------|------|---------------|-------------|
| `PERF_TIMING_ENABLED` | BOOLEAN | "" | Set the value of the variable to `TRUE` to enable the performance metric gathering. Any value other than `TRUE` disables performance monitoring. For implications of this, see the various method documentation in the {@link PerformanceApi} class. |
